## Hi there, my name is EngineeringSean ðŸ‘‹

In my projects folder, you will find a collection of my projects for my software development portfolio.
My software experience ranges from biotech research projects, to financial data engineering, and workflow automation.

This portfolio is a work in progress because, although all of my code is developed and working, I am currently working on cleaning up my code and uploading it here with clear explanations of what the code does. However, I want to express that each of my experiences listed on my resume will be represented here in a separate project sometime this week...

Thanks,
Sean

P.S.
I am currently working on this project below and plan to upload it here within a few weeks:
